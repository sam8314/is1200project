/*
if current page is not 6 we go to navigation
		if current page is 6:
			we call draw_grid to create grid and put it in the buffer //not called anymore
			we initialize timer (based on mode and difficulty)
			we set player1 active and enter game
			in game (in an infinite loop):
				we convert and draw current buffer
				if !timesup:
					if bullet !inAir:
						we poll buttons ->change angle / shoot (inAir=true)
					else:
						update bullet position, check edge, check target
						if target-hit: remove target from buffer & add score & reset inAir
						if edge: reset inAir
				else: reset active player, wait a little, set other player active

->for checking size: we do it in the buffer: without counting, move to the top of the target , 
then with counting move until end score = 4-count -> size 3 is 1 point, size 1 is 3


user_isr: called 10 times every second by timer interrupt
count++
if (count!=10) return; -> we initialize it before starting timer in the beginning of player_turn
reset flag
if one of the players are active:
	LEDS--
if LEDS = 0:
	we need to let the game know through a variable (timesup=1)
	stop timer (we need to restart it at beginning of others turn and set value on LEDS back to original)
